rbdl_geometry - an advanced geometry library for RBDL

DESCRIPTION

This library contains a numerical tool kit and a function factory 
(SmoothSegmentedFunctionFactory) which builds C2 continuous curves for 
specific applications. The numerical tool kits created thus far are:

SegmentedQuinticBezierToolkit:  highly optimized library for creating and
                                evaluating quintic 2D Bezier curves.

and the functions listed in the function factory primarily relate to 

  1) linear muscle profiles
	  -active-force-length profile
	  -passive-force-length profile
	  -force-velocity provile
	  -tendon-force-length profile
	  ... and a bunch of non-standard compressive elements
        for use with a muscle model that has a small mass
        between the tendon and the muscle - the
        Millard2012AccelerationMuscle in OpenSim.

  2) torque muscle profiles
	-Anderson2007ActiveTorqueAngleCurve
  -Anderson2007ActiveTorqueVelocityCurve
	-Anderson2007PassiveTorqueAngleCurve

  3) neuroswing orthoses spring
	
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

In the near future this library will also contain

1. Geometry tools to represent C2 convex implicit surfaces and enforce 
   contact constraints between two surfaces. This tool kit will be first
   used for simulating foot-ground contact. It could later be used for
   3D muscle wrapping:

   SmoothImplicitSurfaceToolkit
   SmoothImplicitSurface
  
2. Geometry tools to represent quintic Pythagorean Hodograph curves - which are
   special Bezier curves that have an analytic equation for arc-length. This 
   package will also contain code to represent polar Pythagorean Hodographs 
   which will be first used to formulate a foot-ground joint. Later this toolkit
   will be used for a 2D cable transmission system 
   (to simulate muscle wrapping).

   PolarFunctionToolkit
