# C3DFile - lightweight access of motion capture data

C3DFile is a simple library to access motion capture data that is stored
in C3D files. One can retrieve the marker position at individual frames and
also query values from the C3D header and also parameter values.

Oh, and it also comes with a wrapper for GNU Octave.

# Usage

For usage see either in the tests file at tests/c3dfiletests.cc or the
